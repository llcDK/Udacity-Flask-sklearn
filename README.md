# Udacity-Flask-sklearn

## Project Overview

This project is operationalizing a Machine Learning Microservice. With a pre-trained `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, this project automatically setups, containerizes, and then deploys the application to Kubernetes. To achieve this goal, this project completes the following tasks:

### Project Tasks

* Test the project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize the application
* Deploy the containerized application using Docker
* Use log statements in the source code to report logs for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy the container using Kubernetes
* Integrate the project with CircleCI

---

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv and activate it
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
* Create Flask app in Container
* Run via kubectl


## File Descriptions

* Application main source code: `app.py`
* Shell scripts for exeuting the applications: `*.sh`
* Machine Learning Model in folder: `model_data`
* Text files outputted from the project in folder: `output_txt_files`
